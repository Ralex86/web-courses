# Cybersecurity

1. What threat does the internet represent for its users ? What group or organization do you think is the biggest cyber threat ?

I think the major threat for users on the Internet today is user _data integrity_. In fact because the current economic model commonly used by a lot of companies is based on targeted advertising, user data became a valued ressource. Therefore we have to be very careful about what we share online. For instance Facebook last watergate was the Cambridge Analytica data scandal where this private company used Facebook to harveste the personal data of millions of people's Facebook profiles without their consent and used it for political purposes.
